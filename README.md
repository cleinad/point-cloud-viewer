# Point Cloud Viewer
Hello. This is a viewer to visualize point clouds from a dataset.

### Getting started:
Add a dataset to the "data" directory. 

Currently only text files containing space-separated value in the format: `x y z intensity r g b` work. 

More support is on the way for other formats.

an example:
```txt
-2.064 -10.433 -0.942 -1176 108 102 88
-2.073 -10.424 -0.941 -1168 127 125 100
```
